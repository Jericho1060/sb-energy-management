## Fuel Chamber and Generators

Do not change anything on genetors, you can keep the rate to 100% it will not affect how much fuel you are using.

If the generator is set at 100% and the fuel chamber is at 10%, the generator will auto adjust to use what the chamber are giving.

If a generator is set at 10% but the chamber is set at 100%, this will still fully use you fuel rod, the more you are producing is just lost.

So alway let your generators to 100% and only adjust your chamber.
